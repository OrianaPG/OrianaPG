### I'm a beginner frontend developer from Argentina :argentina:

Here are some things about me:

- :seedling: I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and C++.
- :computer: I'm working on small projects to better understand CSS flexbox and grid.
- :heartpulse: I'm passionate about frontend, though my heart has a special place for UI design.
- :blue_heart: Fun fact: I looove the Sonic Adventure soundtrack (and the game, of course), so much so that the Sega Sound Team was my 2nd most listened artist on 2021!
- :globe_with_meridians: We can connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/orianapg/">LinkedIn</a> :)
